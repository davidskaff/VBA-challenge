# Multiple Year Stock Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to create a VBA script that performs an in-depth analysis of stocks over a one-year period, for multiple years in total. The script will provide valuable insights into the performance of each stock, including yearly changes, percentage changes, and total volume.

The script should loop through all the stocks for a given year and output the following information:

Ticker Symbol: The unique symbol representing the stock.
Yearly Change: The difference between the opening price at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.
Percentage Change: The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year.
Total Stock Volume: The total volume of the stock traded during the year.

In addition to the basic functionality, the script should also identify and return the stock with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest Total Volume.

Upon successful completion of this project, we will have a powerful tool for analyzing stock performance over time. This can help in making informed investment decisions and understanding market trends.
